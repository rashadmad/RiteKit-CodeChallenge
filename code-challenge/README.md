# code-challenge for Rite kit

## Explanation
```
Before starting work on this project I look a few competitors of rite kit. After taking a look at how sprout social handles developing social media post I knew creating an appication that was similar would give you guys a look at how things could look in a diffrent light. I saw that you all have a centered card for most of your products I wanted to have a more nested sectioned of application. The major obsticles that I had to take on to complete this project was first and foremost getting vue.js up and running. For some reasson I had great diffuculty with that. It was not the first time I installed vue.js but there are many ways to configure the application. Another obstacle for me was getting confortable dealing with the api. I took advantage of postman to accomplish my goal. I really learned a great deal from this code challenge. One thing I wish I had more time to work on would be setting up lodash and implementing unbouncing I know that it is important. Thanks for your time and consideration
